  "biography": "Einav Peretz-Andersson is a Senior Lecturer and Researcher at the School of Engineering, Jönköping University, Sweden, where she also serves as Program Manager for the Master’s programme in AI Engineering. Her research focuses on AI-driven organizational transformation: how organizations build the strategic, cultural, and operational capabilities needed to adopt AI responsibly at scale. She studies AI adoption and data-driven decision-making, explainable AI (XAI) as a foundation for trust and accountability, and AI governance structures in both public and private sector organizations. With a multidisciplinary background spanning engineering, innovation, and policy-oriented research, Einav bridges academic rigor with practical relevance to support responsible, sustainable, and inclusive digital transformation. She leads interdisciplinary and international research collaborations with institutions such as the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Università degli Studi di Udine (Italy), and Luleå University of Technology.",
